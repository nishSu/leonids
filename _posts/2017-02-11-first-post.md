Given that I have `never` used github before, I feel that James Goldie did an excellent job at making a user-friendly tutorial for the very inexperienced. Reminds me of my computing tutorials where my tutors would make a document with all the lines of code and I would just copy and paste all the lines and code. What a great way to learn :D I learn `nothing`.
